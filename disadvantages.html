    <h2>Disadvantages of Computers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Concerns:</strong> Prolonged computer usage can lead to health problems such as eye strain, poor posture, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use can also contribute to obesity and other health issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Addiction:</strong> Computers, particularly the internet and social media, can be addictive. People may spend excessive time online, leading to negative impacts on social relationships and mental well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Computers are vulnerable to hacking, malware, and viruses. Personal data can be compromised, leading to identity theft and other cybercrimes.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> Automation and the rise of artificial intelligence powered by computers can lead to job displacement in certain sectors, as machines and algorithms replace human workers.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Issues:</strong> The widespread use of computers raises concerns about privacy. Personal data can be collected and misused by companies, governments, or cybercriminals.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> The production, usage, and disposal of computers contribute to electronic waste (e-waste), which can be harmful to the environment if not properly managed.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Over-reliance on computers, particularly in communication and entertainment, can lead to social isolation and a decline in face-to-face interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Problems:</strong> Computers can experience technical issues such as hardware malfunctions, software bugs, or network problems, which can disrupt work and lead to frustration.</li>
    </ul>
